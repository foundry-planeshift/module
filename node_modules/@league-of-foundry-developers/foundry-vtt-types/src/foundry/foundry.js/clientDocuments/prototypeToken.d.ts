/**
 * An extended Document definition used specifically
 * This ensures that the PrototypeTokenData schema is used instead of the standard TokenData.
 * This exists specifically for prototype Token configuration in the TokenConfig app and should not be used otherwise.
 * @internal
 * @remarks The types for this are incorrect, in particular everything related to the data should use
 * {@link foundry.data.PrototypeTokenData} instead of {@link foundry.data.TokenData}. However, with the current approach
 * to type documents, we don't see a way to do this. This class is just added for reference. As the documentation above
 * says, don't use it (there really shouldn't be a need to do so).
