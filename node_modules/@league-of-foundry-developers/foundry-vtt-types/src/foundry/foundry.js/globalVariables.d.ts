   * Some global variables (such as {@link game}) are only initialized after certain events have happened during the
   * initialization of Foundry VTT. For that reason, the correct types for these variables include the types for the
   * uninitialized state.
   *
   * While this is correct from a type checking perspective, it can be inconvenient to have to type guard these global
   * variables everywhere. Some users might prefer the convenience over the 100% correctness in type checking.
   *
   * For this reason, this interface provides a way for users to configure certain global variables to be typed more
   * leniently, i.e., as the types of their initialized state. This is done via declaration merging. To configure a
   * specific global variable to be typed leniently, the user simply needs to merge a property with the name of the
   * variable into this interface (the type doesn't matter).
   *
   * The currently supported variables are:
   * - {@link game}
   * - {@link socket}
   * - {@link ui}
   * - {@link canvas}
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * declare global {
   *   interface LenientGlobalVariableTypes {
   *     game: never; // the type doesn't matter
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * const referenceToGame: Game = game; // ok! :)
   * ```
